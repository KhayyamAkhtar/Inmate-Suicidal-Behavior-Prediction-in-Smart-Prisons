The dataset is from the Criminal Justice Co-Occurring Disorder Screening Instrument (CODSI) ICPSR 27963 study from Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. (Link: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NAHDAP/studies/27963/versions/V1)

The dataset represents information about US inmates across 14 facilities participating in prison-based drug abuse treatment programs. It contains records for total of 353 prisoners for which we identified independent variables as features and one dependent feature variable namely ”suicide ever attempted in life”. Out of the 915 variables in the dataset, some variables were derived using simple formulas (using if-else statements) from other source variables. We included both source and derived variables in our study.
