This repository contains the code and resources related to our research paper titled "Predicting Inmate Suicidal Behavior with an Interpretable Ensemble Approach in Smart Prisons." The paper addresses the critical issue of predicting suicidal behavior using dataset containing features about inmates enrolled in drug abuse treatment program.

# Paper Abstract
The convergence of smart technologies and predictive modelling in prisons presents an exciting opportunity to revolutionize the monitoring of inmate behaviour, allowing for the early detection of signs of distress and the effective mitigation of suicide risks. While machine learning algorithms have been extensively employed in predicting suicidal behaviour, a critical aspect that has often been overlooked is the interoperability of these models. Most of the work done on model interpretations for suicide predictions often limits itself to feature reduction and highlighting important contributing features only. To address this research gap, we used Anchor explanations for creating human-readable statements based on simple rules, which, to our knowledge, have never been used before for suicide prediction models. We also overcome the limitation of anchor explanations, which create weak rules on high-dimensionality datasets, by first reducing data features via SHAP. We further reduce data features through anchor interpretations for the final ensemble model of XGBoost and Random Forest. A dataset was selected from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, containing information about 353 US inmates across 14 facilities participating in prison-based drug abuse treatment programs. The dependent variable was identified as ”suicide ever attempted in life”. Our results indicate significant differences when compared with state-of-the-art models, having an accuracy increase of 14.6% (=98.6%) and an increase in precision of 16.0% (=0.986). Comparing the F1-score for best non-suicide ideation models, we gain an increase of 1.5% (=0.859) and an increase in precision of 2.9% (=0.944). Comparing the F1-score for best suicide ideation models, we gain an increase of 20.8% (=0.967) and an increase in precision of 8.4% (=0.986) at similar false negatives (=1) but improved false positives (=0).
